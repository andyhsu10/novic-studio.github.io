      <p class="text fw-bold">
        In 2019, <br/>
        the largest-ever global pandemic "Covid-19" broke out. <br/>
        Governments around the world made every effort to develop vaccines to counter the virus.<br/>
        In 2020 Taiwan developed a vaccine called the "Tylight Vaccine". <br/>
        After a successful phase iii trial,<br/>
        the Taiwanese government vaccinated a portion of its population with it and sold what was left to the United States and Japan.<br/>
        Not long after, a small number of people that took the Tylight Vaccine began to develop superpowers such as teleportation, magnetism, <br/>
        superhuman strength, or abilities that went beyond the limitations of human beings. 
        <br/><br/>

        These incidents were then reported by many mainstream Media, <br/>
        which grabbed the attention of world leaders. <br/>
        Nations scrambled and sought to obtain the vaccine.<br/>
        The Taiwanese government then used this opportunity to request countries seeking the Tylight vaccine to vote in favor of Taiwan joining the U.N. <br/><br/>

        With all this commotion,<br/>
        China saw the potential threat of Taiwan actually achieving its independence.<br/>
        Furthermore,  the increasing number of super-powered individuals “awakening” on the island also threatens to disrupt China's military superiority.<br/><br/>
        
        
        After Taiwan denied China’s request for Tylight, <br/>
        the Chinese military declared war and sent the entire People's Liberation Army Navy to invade the island.<br/>
        However, to everyone’s amazement,<br/>
        the Taiwanese army easily destroyed hundreds of incoming Chinese battleships and missiles with the assistance of their superhumans.<br/><br/>

        As the Taiwan Strait war ended,<br/>
        the United States stepped in,<br/>
        requesting a cease-fire between the two countries.<br/>
        In the aftermath,<br/>
        Taiwan and China signed the Taipei Treaty,<br/>
        a mutual non-aggression agreement.<br/>
        The terms included China renouncing its military operations against Taiwan and formally recognizing Taiwan as an independent country.<br/>
        Little did people know, <br/>
        even though the war ended at sea,<br/>
        another war was lurking,<br/>
        and this time it wouldn't be between countries…<br/>
        it would be a war between heroes and villains with extraordinary feats….<br/>
